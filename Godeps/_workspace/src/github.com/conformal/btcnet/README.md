Package btcnet defines the network parameters for the three standard Bitcoin 
networks and provides the ability for callers to define their own custom 
Bitcoin networks.

This package is one of the core packages from btcd, an alternative full-node
implementation of Bitcoin which is under active development by Conformal.
Although it was primarily written for btcd, this package has intentionally been
designed so it can be used as a standalone package for any projects needing to
use parameters for the standard Bitcoin networks or for projects needing to
define their own network.

## Sample Use

```Go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/conformal/btcnet"
	"github.com/conformal/btcutil"
)

var testnet = flag.Bool("testnet", false, "operate on the testnet Bitcoin network")

// By default (without -testnet), use mainnet.
var netParams = &btcnet.MainNetParams

func main() {
	flag.Parse()

	// Modify active network parameters if operating on testnet.
	if *testnet {
		netParams = &btcnet.TestNet3Params
	}

	// later...

	// Create and print new payment address, specific to the active network.
	pubKeyHash := make([]byte, 20)
	addr, err := btcutil.NewAddressPubKeyHash(pubKeyHash, netParams)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(addr)
}
```
